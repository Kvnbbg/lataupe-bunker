2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

    Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive license:

    a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
       Licensable by that Contributor, to use, reproduce, make available,
       modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
       Contributor Version; and

    b. under Patent Claims of that Contributor which would be infringed by
       the making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, or
       distributing of its Contributor Version in Source Code Form, to make,
       have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transact
       Contributor Version in Source Code Form.

    A Contributor may choose not to grant the patent license set forth in
    Section 2.1(b) for its Contributor Version by providing notice of such
    election to You in the Source Code form of the Contributor Version it
    distributes. If You are (or act on behalf of) the Initial Developer,
    Your election of not granting the patent license is invalid.

    All other patent claims owned or controlled by Contributor are expressly
    excluded.

    This License is effective on the date You first use, receive, or copy
    the Covered Software.

2.2. Effective Date

    The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contributor
    Version become effective for each Contributor on the date the Contributor
    first distributes that Contributor Version.

2.3. Limitations on Scope of Patent License

    The patent license granted in Section 2.1(b) is only for the Contributor's
    share of infringement of the Patent Claims by the Contributor Version.
    If You combine Covered Software with other software and distribute that
    Larger Work, the patent license granted in Section 2.1(b) by that
    Contributor does not apply to the Patent Claims infringed by that Larger
    Work.

2.4. Conditions

    You must cause the Covered Software to carry a prominent notice in each
    file of its Source Code Form stating that the file is subject to this
    License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
    Source Code Form of the Covered Software You distribute or make available.
    You must inform anyone who receives the Source Code Form of the Covered
    Software from You that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is
    governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy
    of this License.

    You may not offer or impose any terms on the Source Code Form that alter
    or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
    rights hereunder.

    You may not charge a royalty or other fee for the Covered Software
    when distributed in Source Code Form.

    You may distribute the Executable Form of the Covered Software under
    the terms of this License or under a license of Your choice, which may
    contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
    compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
    Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
    rights in the Source Code Form beyond the terms of this License.

    If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable Form only, You must
    make the Source Code Form of the Covered Software publicly available in
    accordance with Section 3.2, and You must inform recipients how they can
    obtain a copy of the Source Code Form.

    You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, or
    attribution notices present in the Source Code Form.

    You must give any recipient of the Executable Form a copy of the Source
    Code Form or a means of obtaining a copy of the Source Code Form.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Code Form

    All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
    Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be
    governed by the terms of this License. You must inform anyone who
    receives the Source Code Form of the Covered Software from You that the
    Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
    License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License.

3.2. Availability of Source Code Form

    Any Executable Form of Covered Software that You distribute must be made
    available in Source Code Form. You must make the Source Code Form of the
    Covered Software publicly available in accordance with this Section 3.2,
    and You must inform recipients how they can obtain a copy of the Source
    Code Form.

    You may satisfy this requirement by including a copy of the Source Code
    Form with each copy of the Executable Form You distribute or by providing
    access to the Source Code Form from a location that is readily accessible
    to the public for at least 12 months after the date it was first
    distributed, or until You cease to distribute the Covered Software,
    whichever occurs first. You may charge a reasonable fee for the cost of
    copying and distributing the Source Code Form. The Source Code Form must
    remain available at no charge to the public if You make it available via
    an Internet download site.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
order, or regulation then You must:

a. comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and
b. describe the limitations and the code they affect.

Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions
of the Covered Software under this License. The description must be
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand
it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. For Cause

    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    if You fail to comply with a term of this License and fail to cure such
    breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. For the avoidance
    of doubt, if You cease to distribute the Covered Software, Your obligations
    under this License with respect to that Covered Software will terminate.

5.2. Effect of Termination

    Upon termination of this License, all rights granted to You under this
    License will cease. However, any obligations that You incurred prior to
    termination of this License will remain in effect.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty
-------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk
as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should
any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor)
assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This
disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use
of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone
distributing Covered Software as permitted by this License, be liable to You
for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of
the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply
to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Contributor's
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the Contributor maintains its principal place of business
and such litigation shall be governed by the laws of that jurisdiction, without
reference to its conflict of law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
prevent a party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. This License may not be modified except in a writing signed by
Contributors. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
License.
